# Build with ready-made binaries

I think this method serves my goal better, cause "build from source code" use "debuild" are too much automated. 

All I need to show the "control" "postinstall" "prerm" in "DEBIAN" and the real files going to be installed.




# build from source code
follow 
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Basic?action=show

everthing works but the final step

    debuild -S

the error:

    secret key not available

it seems that debuild will get the email-address in changlog, and use this to find the key, anyway, something really stupid.

Luckily follow
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Debian/2004-12/4422.html

I can use

    debuild -us -uc

to ignore the key.

but if you check `man debuild`, it want us to use

    debuild -i -us -uc -b
