everthing works but the final step

    debuild -S

the error:

    secret key not available

it seems that debuild will get the email-address in changlog, and use this to find the key, anyway, something really stupid.

Luckily follow

I can use

    debuild -us -uc

to ignore the key.

but if you check `man debuild`, it want us to use

    debuild -i -us -uc -b
