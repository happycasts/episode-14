#DEBIAN/control

`dpkg -l` can list the short description, double click the package to open it in "ubuntu software center", you can get a lot.

goto

if you want to add a screenshot for your pkg, but it seems that you pkg most in ubuntu/debian repo already.

change name:

    peter:~/xxx$ dpkg-name debian.deb 
    dpkg-name: info: moved 'debian.deb' to './happyhello_1.0_all.deb'


now this error  installing with SoftwareCenter

    E: happyhello: wrong-file-owner-uid-or-gid usr/ 1000/1000


this is solved by fakeroot

    peter:~/xxx$ fakeroot
    root:~/xxx# dpkg-deb --build debian
    dpkg-deb: building package `happyhello' in `debian.deb'.

Edit: fakeroot will be auto-setup  if I install dpkg-dev( for dpkg-name), so now the "1000, 1000" problem no longer reproduciable.

now the error

   doesn't provide a valid Installed-Size control field. See Debian Policy 5.6.20.

now I google "Debian Policy 5.6.20", and get sth really useful:

and this is the best tutorial ever:

# Build with ready-made binaries

I think this method serves my goal better, cause "build from source code" use "debuild" are too much automated. 

# build from source code
follow 
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Basic?action=show

everthing works but the final step

    debuild -S

the error:

    secret key not available

it seems that debuild will get the email-address in changlog, and use this to find the key, anyway, something really stupid.

Luckily follow
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Debian/2004-12/4422.html

I can use

    debuild -us -uc

to ignore the key.

but if you check `man debuild`, it want us to use

    debuild -i -us -uc -b
